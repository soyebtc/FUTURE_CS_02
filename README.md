# FUTURE_CS_02 - Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response (Splunk)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and responding to security incidents using **Splunk Enterprise**.  
As part of an internship-style task, I simulated real-world log ingestion, detection, and incident reporting.

---

## 🛠️ Data Sources
The following log files were ingested into Splunk:
- **failed_logins.txt** → SSH brute-force attempts  
- **web_access.log** → Web server access logs  
- **malware_alerts.log** → Antivirus detection logs  

---

## 📊 Splunk Dashboards & Searches
- Monitored **failed login attempts** to detect brute-force activity.  
- Tracked **web server requests** to identify suspicious access.  
- (Simulated) **malware detection alerts** to respond to endpoint infections.  

---

## 📝 Incident Response Report
A full incident response report was generated, covering:
1. **Alert Analysis** – Key findings from ingested logs  
2. **Incident Classification** – Brute-force, Web attacks, and Malware detections  
3. **Remediation Recommendations** – Steps to mitigate risks

## 📷 Screenshots
Screenshots of Splunk dashboards and searches are included in the report.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand Splunk dashboards for automated alerts  
- Simulate additional attack scenarios (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)  
- Explore integration with SOAR for automated response
